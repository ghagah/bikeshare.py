# bikeshare.py


Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, i  use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. i write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. i also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics

in this project, i  use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. i compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington
